### App Demo 

To get the disease classification the app requires a picture of a leaf of the suspected plant.

If the plant is healthy then no further action required.

If the plant is infected then by tapping on the the 'Know about the disease' button a bottom sheet appears with relevant information about the disease and some controlling measures
